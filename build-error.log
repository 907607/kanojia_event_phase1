 We detected multiple lockfiles and 
selected the directory of 
C:\Users\Rahul Kanojia\Desktop\Kanojia

Shoppe\phase1\package-lock.json as the 
root directory.
 To silence this warning, set 
`turbopack.root` in your Next.js 
config, or consider removing one of 
the lockfiles if it's not needed.

Γ¿» ERROR: This build is using 
Turbopack, with a `webpack` config and 
no `turbopack` config.
   This may be a mistake.

   As of Next.js 16 Turbopack is 
enabled by default and
   custom webpack configurations may 
need to be migrated to Turbopack.

   NOTE: your `webpack` config may 
have been added by a configuration 
plugin.

   To configure Turbopack, see https://
nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-
config-js/turbopack

   TIP: Many applications work fine 
under Turbopack with no configuration,
   if that is the case for you, you 
can silence this error by passing the
   `--turbopack` or `--webpack` flag 
explicitly or simply setting an 
   empty turbopack config in your Next 
config file (e.g. `turbopack: {}`).
